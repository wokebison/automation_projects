### File logger
Script that is useful for keeping track of any changes made to a specific directory;
Say for example, this would be useful to keep track of the changes in and out of a folder like Downloads.

Downloads Organizer is an implementation of the file logger for my own personal use.


### File organizer
Script that is useful for reorganizing directories of messy folders like the download folder.
In its vanila form, it is only useful for moving bulks of files without logic;
In later versions, logic for moving different files into different folders will be added.


### File renamer
Script that is useful for parsing and renaming a bunch of files in a similar format, in a single directory.



### Compound interest Calc
Script that automatically calculates the compounded interest over time.

### Trade position calc
Script that automatically returns the trade size, the position size, capital at risk, R/R of a trade.
