### File logger
File logger keeps track of any changes in the current working directory and prints them out (in its current form);
Easily adjustable to keep a .txt log of all changes which will soon be done.


### File organizer
Recursive script that automatically moves files from one directory to another;
You can also program if/then logic to move different files to different directories, as well as to add functionality for renaming files as they are being moved.
